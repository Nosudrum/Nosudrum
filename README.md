<!-- ## Hi there 👋 -->

## Welcome <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="25">

👋 Hi there! I'm Arnaud, a French (but European by heart) student passionate about space, technology, engineering and a lot of other stuff.

👨‍🎓 After doing a BSc and MSc in Mechanical Engineering at EPFL, with one year of exchange in Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft, I am now doing a double-degree in Aerospace Engineering at ISAE-Supaéro.

💻 Outside of my studies, you will can find me heavily invested in [The Space Devs](https://thespacedevs.com) 🛰️ as a core staff member for the [Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) 🚀 and [Spaceflight News](https://thespacedevs.com/snapi) 📰 APIs.

🎮 Apart from that, you might encounter me at the helm of ships of all sizes alongside crewmates looking for good fights and treasure on [Sea of Thieves](https://www.seaofthieves.com/) 🏴‍☠️.

Finally, in no particular order, I like :
- Trains
- Nuclear power
- European cooperation
- Vector design
- Videogames & custom PCs
- Films & music (how original)
